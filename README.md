Website performance analysis.

This is a pet-project, in which I wanted to demonstrate and strengthen my knowledge.

The project involved analyzing the performance of a website. 

As an analyst, I had to analyze the pages of a web site and figure out the problems, if any. Draw conclusions.

The data contains two groups of devices: an experimental group and a control group.

Before starting the main part of the analysis, I preprocessed the data: checking for data population, data type, duplicates, etc.

Next was the analysis where I calculated which pages of the website were visited the most. To make it clearer, a funnel was built that showed how many people visited the website pages and conversion. 

After doing all the research work, I drew conclusions with the possible reason for the conversion problems on each page.
